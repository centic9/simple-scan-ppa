Description: Simple Scanning Utility
 Simple Scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users
 connect their scanner and quickly have the image/document in an
 appropriate format.
 .
 Simple Scan is basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same
 backend as XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will
 work and the interface is well tested.
